# We need a new name #

I have, as I usually do, simply labeled the project as "stuff" - as that's what it is... ;)
"BomberStuff" is (unless everybody likes it too much, which I can't imagine) only a temporary title for the project.

This is the place to discuss possible names. Everyone is invited to leave comments.
Please suggest new names and/or comment on things other people suggested.

Please note that this is not of a high priority, so the decision to a final name might take some time.
