A remake of the classic "Atomic Bomberman", written in C# and designed for portability, as well as providing the ability to re-use the original game resources (graphics, sounds, schemes).

The project is in search for a new name, "Bomber Stuff" is the temporary working title. Suggestions are welcome.

I am also always looking for people designing new graphics in order to provide a free alternative to the original game resources.

The project is currently being re-done with the new design goals of modularity and portability in mind. It is expected to reach the previous feature set some time in April 2010.

The current Version is Alpha 0.1.1 Build 115, released 2010-02-25.
