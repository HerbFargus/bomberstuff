# Introduction #

This guide is intended for people interested in the developer's point of view on BomberStuff. Perhaps you are thinking about contributing, or using some of the code from the project, or maybe you just want to make a little change to the code to enable you to cheat. Whatever ;)

In any case, on this page, I will try to explain the basic ideas and design concepts behind the source code.

A little knowledge (or game experience ;]) of the original Atomic Bomberman might be helpful, and as BomberStuff is written in C#, having an idea of the language, or at least object oriented programming in general, will most likely be required.
